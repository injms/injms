# Hi, I'm Ian.

And I make things for the web.

Sometimes big things - currently I'm lead frontend developer for [GOV.UK].

Sometimes small things - like a [Carbon Gizmo][carbon_gizmo], [Squarify][squarify], or any attempt to _once again try and consistently blog_.

Based near [cloudy Guildford][weather_in_guildford] ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ for the moment, I'm about to move to [stormy Geelong][weather_in_geelong] ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º.

My work and personal project code is here on [GitHub][github], my CV is on [LinkedIn][linkedin], and some photos are on [Instagram][instagram]. You should take a look.
